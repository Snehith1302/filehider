This project is a terminal-based authentication system built on a MySQL database (v 8.0.33). 
It replaces traditional passwords with OTP-based login and signup, where users receive a one-time passcode via email for secure access. 
The system emphasizes simplicity and functionality in a non-GUI environment.
